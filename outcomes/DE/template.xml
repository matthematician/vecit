        <intro>
            <p>A farmer is building a grain silo intended to hold <m>{{constraint}}\pi</m> cubic meters of grain.  The silo has a cylindrical body with radius <m>r</m> meters and height <m>h</m> meters, with a hemispheric dome with radius <m>r</m> meters.  The cost of materials for the floor is $<m>{{floor}}</m> per square meter, but the cost of materials for the dome is $<m>{{dome}}</m> per square meter, and the cost of building the side is $<m>{{wall}}</m> per square meter.</p>
