                The circulation of the vector field <m>\mathbf{F}(x,y) = \left\langle {{fx}}, {{fy}} \right\rangle</m> along which of the curves illustrated below is equal to <m>{{circ}}</m>? Explain your answer.

                Since <m>\dfrac{\partial F_2}{\partial x} - \dfrac{\partial F_1}{\partial y} = {{scurl}}</m>, the appropriate curve is <m>C_{ {{which}} }</m> since <m>\iint_{C_{ {{which}} }} {{scurl}}\, dA = {{circ}}.</m>

                Use Green's theorem to find the counterclockwise circulation of <m>\mathbf{G}(x,y) = \left\langle {{gx}}, {{gy}} \right\rangle</m> around the circle <m>x^2+y^2 = {{r}}</m>.

            <p>
                By Green's theorem this is equal to <m>\iint_{x^2+y^2 \leq {{r}} } {{integrand}} \,dA = {{ans}}.</m>
