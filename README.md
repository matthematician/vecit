# VecIt!

CheckIt! problems bank aligned to a set of learning standards from Schlicker et al.'s Active Calculus: Vector textbook ( http://activecalculus.org/vector ).

Public version of the bank is available here: http://matthematician.github.io/vecit/ .
Development on branch `final`.

For more information about the CheckIt! platform see http://checkit.clontz.org .

## VecIt! Learning Standards

The learning standards below are arranged into *core* standards, with slugs ending in numerals (e.g., D4) and *supplementary* standards, with slugs ending in letters (e.g., VF). Core standards are intended to align with the fundamental, threshold knowledge of vector calculus while supplementary standards provide opportunities to extend core skills into deeper and broader applications.

### N: Use vectors and vector operations to “navigate” two- and three-space. (Ch. 9)

N1 Surfaces and Graphs
: Use traces and contours to describe surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are graphs of two-variable functions and level sets of three-variable functions, including quadric surfaces.

N2 Vector Arithmetic
: Perform and geometrically interpret sums, differences, scalar multiples, and magnitudes of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

N3 Vector Geometry
: Choose among, and use, dot products and cross products of vectors to compute quantities of geometric interest, including angles and areas.

N4 Parametrized Lines
: Determine parametric equations for a line in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined either by a point and a direction vector, or by an intersection of two planes.

N5 Planes
: Determine a level set equation for a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined either by a point and a normal vector, or by three given non-collinear points.

NA Parametrized Curves
: Sketch and parameterize portions of oriented curves, including those defined by intersections of surfaces and those which involve circular motions.
