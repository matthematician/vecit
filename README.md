# VecIt!

CheckIt! problems bank aligned to a set of "core" learning standards from Schlicker et al.'s Active Calculus: Vector textbook ( http://activecalculus.org/vector ).

Public version of the bank is available here: http://matthematician.github.io/vecit/ .
Development on branch `final`.

# VecIt! Learning Standards

## N: Use vectors and vector operations to “navigate” two- and three-space.
### (Active Calculus Chapter 9)

N1 Surfaces and Graphs
: Use traces and contours to describe surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are graphs of two-variable functions and level sets of three-variable functions, including quadric surfaces.
