# VecIt!

CheckIt! problems bank aligned to a set of learning standards from Schlicker et al.'s Active Calculus: Vector textbook ( http://activecalculus.org/vector ).

Public version of the bank is available here: http://matthematician.github.io/vecit/ .
Development on branch `final`.

## VecIt! Learning Standards

The learning standards below are arranged into *core* standards, with slugs ending in numerals (e.g., D4) and *supplementary* standards, with slugs ending in letters (e.g., VF). Core standards are intended to align with the fundamental, threshold knowledge of vector calculus while supplementary standards provide opportunities to extend core skills into deeper and broader applications.

### N: Use vectors and vector operations to “navigate” two- and three-space. (Ch. 9)

N1 Surfaces and Graphs
: Use traces and contours to describe surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ that are graphs of two-variable functions and level sets of three-variable functions, including quadric surfaces.

N2 Vector Arithmetic
: Perform and geometrically interpret sums, differences, scalar multiples, and magnitudes of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$.

N3 Vector Geometry
: Choose among, and use, dot products and cross products of vectors to compute quantities of geometric interest, including angles and areas.

N4 Parametrized Lines
: Determine parametric equations for a line in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined either by a point and a direction vector, or by an intersection of two planes.

N5 Planes
: Determine a level set equation for a plane in $\mathbb{R}^3$ defined either by a point and a normal vector, or by three given non-collinear points.

NA Parametrized Curves
: Sketch and parameterize portions of oriented curves, including those defined by intersections of surfaces and those which involve circular motions.

NB Derivatives and Curves
: Use derivatives to determine, and distinguish among, a parameterized curve’s tangent, speed, velocity, and acceleration.

NC Parametrized Surfaces
: Find a two-variable parametrization for portions of surfaces defined as graphs of two-variable functions and level sets of three-variable functions.

### D: Use and understand derivatives of multivariable functions in a variety of forms.

DA Multivariable Limits
: Use continuity and polar-coordinate methods to calculate limits of multivariable functions, and use multiple-approach methods to demonstrate when such a limit does not exist.

D1 Partial Derivative Computation
: Compute the partial derivatives of a given multivariable function, up to second order.

DB Partial Derivative Interpretation
: Carefully interpret the first- and second-order partial derivatives of a multivariable function as slopes and concavities of its graph’s traces.

D2 Tangent Planes
: Find equations for tangent planes to surfaces expressed as graphs of two-variable functions and as level sets of three-variable functions.

DC Multivariable Chain Rule
: Identify all “routes” of composition when two or more multivariable functions are composed, and use the multivariable chain rule to compute such a function’s partial derivatives.

D3 The Gradient of $f(x,y)$
: Compute the gradient vector of a two-variable function, give its geometric interpretation with respect both to the contours of the function and to its graph, and use it to calculate directional derivatives in a given direction.

DD The Gradient of $F(x,y,z)$
: Compute the gradient vector of a three-variable function, give its geometric interpretation with respect to its level surfaces, and use it to calculate directional derivatives in a given direction.

D4 Critical Points of Multivariable Functions
: Use its gradient vector to locate critical points of a multivariable function, and its second-order partial derivatives to classify critical points as local maximum, local minimum, saddle points, or degenerate.

DE Optimization and Extreme Values of Multivariable Functions
: Use both critical points and a parametrization of its boundary to find absolute maximum and minimum values of a multivariable function on a closed and bounded domain.

DF Constrained Optimization
: Use Lagrange multipliers to determine absolute maximum and minimum values of a multivariable function subject to one or more constraint equations.

### S: Set up and evaluate integrals of multivariable functions using a variety of strategies.

S1 The "Tape-Measure Method"
> Describe a given region in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ using
coordinate inequalities, in at least two distinct ways.
